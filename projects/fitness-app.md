# Coach@Home
In this post I'm introducing a new solution for the fitness world, an ecosystem of mobile and web applications, as well as a Chrome extension. 
For coaches, physiotherapists, and personal trainers, but firstly for the person trying to improve their well-being and fitness, Coach@Home is present wherever you are - with a  focus on at home training, remote video assessments, and allowing for customisation based on what equipment you have available.

A comprehensive review of potential [competitors]('/competitors') and parallel software products, as well as evaluating the size of the potential market has guided the design of an innovative and unparalleled solution.

## The changing fitness and rehab space - technology, COVID and beyond
Traditionally fitness as well as rehab work has focused on brick and mortar gyms, and in-person assessments (for rehab and coaching). Often assisted by tools such as [Coaches eye](https://www.coachseye.com/) for coaching or video evaluation tools such as DrGoniometer [Review](https://bjsm-bmj-com.salford.idm.oclc.org/content/51/23/1703) for movement assessment, these are all still in-person, high personal contact areas, and so are the gyms.
In a post COVID world, home exercise, injury assessment and coaching are all going to see massive uptake. 
This trend is immediately apparent by looking at Google trends for selected terms:

*All graphs are run 2015-04-04 to 2020-04-04, for the global region - and the note at 2016/1/1 indicates a Google change in collection stats. Obviously these results will be skewed for english language countries*
