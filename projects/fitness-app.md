# Coach@Home
In this post I'm introducing a new solution for the fitness world, an ecosystem of mobile and web applications, as well as a Chrome extension. 
For coaches, physiotherapists, and personal trainers, but firstly for the person trying to improve their well-being and fitness, Coach@Home is present wherever you are - with a  focus on at home training, remote video assessments, and allowing for customisation based on what equipment you have available.

A comprehensive review of potential [competitors]('/competitors') and parallel software products, as well as evaluating the size of the potential market has guided the design of an innovative and unparalleled solution.

## The changing fitness and rehab space - technology, COVID and beyond
Traditionally fitness as well as rehab work has focused on brick and mortar gyms, and in-person assessments (for rehab and coaching). Often assisted by tools such as [Coaches eye](https://www.coachseye.com/) for coaching or video evaluation tools such as DrGoniometer [Review](https://bjsm-bmj-com.salford.idm.oclc.org/content/51/23/1703) for movement assessment, these are all still in-person, high personal contact areas, and so are the gyms.
In a post COVID world, home exercise, injury assessment and coaching are all going to see massive uptake. 
This trend is immediately apparent by looking at Google trends for selected terms:

*All graphs are run 2015-04-04 to 2020-04-04, for the global region - and the note at 2016/1/1 indicates a Google change in collection stats. Obviously these results will be skewed for english language countries*

Note the new years spike in interest in Home Fitness!

These examples all show that interest in training at home just spiked recently - but other data also show that is the acceleration of a pre-existing trend, rather than a blip to go away on discovery of a vaccine.

YouTube's interactive [With me](https://youtube.com/trends/articles/with-me-interactive/) infographic highlights a broader movement of online, not just fitness, learning. 

An example of the excellent charts linked in that article:

Staying with YouTube



Another analysis by YouTube, looking at the searches for "[Workout at home](https://youtube.com/trends/articles/stay-home-workout-at-home/)":
"*Global average daily views of videos with 'workout at home' in the title have increased by over 200% since March 15 compared to their average views for the rest of the year.
Six of the year's top 20 biggest live streams, based on peak concurrent viewership, have been PE With Joe live streams*"
